I believe that all of the members did their job great. I have had a great teamwork experience with every member. Although I did face a lot of challenges and difficulties, I have always had my teammates alongside me every time I needed help. I can tell that every member of the team has done their best for the assignment, and it is the thing that matters. With the unity of the whole group, the report for assignment 3 came out fascinating. However, I suppose that our project idea can be developed even more. We all have so many ideas to put in the project, but we did not have enough time to go for it. Nevertheless, I believe it also gave me a lesson about planning and scheduling my work. When I work in a team, it is totally different from working individually. It requires me to manage my work and time appropriately. One thing that surprised me is that I have never thought a project report could be this complicated. There were so many more problems that needed to be addressed when it came to writing a report than I had ever thought.
